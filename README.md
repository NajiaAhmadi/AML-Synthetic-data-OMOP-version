# AML-Synthetic-Data-OMOP-Version

This repository hosts the OMOP-formatted version of the Synthetic Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) dataset, available at (https://zenodo.org/records/8334265).

### Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) Process
The transformation of the synthetic dataset into the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) was executed using a pipeline developed through our collaborative research, detailed at this (https://github.com/NajiaAhmadi/colab.-AML-study). The OMOP-compatible synthetic data facilitates various types of analysis using Artificial Intelligence methods to explore hypotheses related to AML.
